Indian Number Plate Detection and OCR
Unlocking Insights from Indian Roads

Revolutionizing vehicle monitoring and surveillance, our cutting-edge project combines real-time object detection with advanced Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to decipher license plate information from vehicles on Indian roads.

Key Features:

Real-Time Object Detection: Powered by the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 model, our system dynamically identifies vehicles and their number plates with exceptional accuracy, even in challenging lighting and weather conditions.

Custom Dataset Training: Leveraging a meticulously curated custom dataset, our model is finely tuned to recognize diverse vehicle types and license plate variations prevalent on Indian roads, ensuring robust performance in real-world scenarios.

Efficient Text Extraction: Seamlessly integrating with the EasyOCR library, our system effortlessly extracts alphanumeric text from detected number plates, delivering swift and accurate results for further processing.

Specialized Indian Number Plate Recognition: Engineered specifically for Indian license plates,  OCR module finely tunes its recognition capabilities to decode Indian vehicle registration details with.

Intelligent Number-Text Mapping: proprietary function intelligently maps numeric characters to corresponding text representations and vice versa, adhering to the unique format specifications of Indian license plates.

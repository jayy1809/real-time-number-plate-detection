Indian Number Plate Detection and OCR
Unlocking Insights from Indian Roads

Revolutionizing vehicle monitoring and surveillance, this project combines real-time object detection with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to decipher license plate information from vehicles on Indian roads.



Key Features:

Real-Time Object Detection: Powered by the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 model, our system dynamically identifies vehicles and their number plates with exceptional accuracy, even in challenging lighting and weather conditions.

Custom Dataset Training: Leveraging a meticulously curated custom dataset, our model is finely tuned to recognize diverse vehicle types and license plate variations prevalent on Indian roads, ensuring robust performance in real-world scenarios.

Efficient Text Extraction: Seamlessly integrating with the EasyOCR library, our system effortlessly extracts alphanumeric text from detected number plates, delivering swift and accurate results for further processing.

Specialized Indian Number Plate Recognition: Engineered specifically for Indian license plates,  OCR module finely tunes its recognition capabilities to decode Indian vehicle registration details with.

Intelligent Number-Text Mapping: proprietary function intelligently maps numeric characters to corresponding text representations and vice versa, adhering to the unique format specifications of Indian license plates.



Technologies Used:

YOLOv8: State-of-the-art object detection model for real-time vehicle detection.
EasyOCR: Advanced Optical Character Recognition library for efficient text extraction.
OpenCV: Powerful computer vision library for image processing and manipulation.
Python: Programming language used for implementation and development.


Number Plate Real-Time Detection
This project performs real-time object detection to detect number plates in images or video streams. It utilizes the YOLOv8 model trained on a custom dataset for accurate object detection. Additionally, it uses EasyOCR to extract text from the detected number plates. Specialized functions are implemented to handle Indian number plates more accurately.



To perform real-time number plate detection and text extraction, use the following functions:

real_time_prediction: Detects number plates in real-time from images or video streams.
indian_prediction: Extracts text from Indian number plates using fine-tuned OCR.



Applications:

Law Enforcement: Enable law enforcement agencies to swiftly identify and track vehicles involved in criminal activities or traffic violations.
Traffic Management: Facilitate efficient traffic flow monitoring and congestion management through automated vehicle tracking and analysis.
Vehicle Registration: Streamline vehicle registration processes by automating the capture and verification of license plate information.
